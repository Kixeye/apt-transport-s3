## Requirements
### Additional package dependencies (except installed by default in Debian)
1. python-configobj

## Configuration
/etc/apt/s3auth.conf or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role</a>
can provide credentials required for using private apt repositories.

Example of s3auth.conf file:
```
AccessKeyId = myaccesskey
SecretAccessKey = mysecretaccesskey
Token = ''
```

Token should be empty string.

Example of an IAM Policy (noting the ARN differs in China):
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1247539516000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1247539516001",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::aptbucketname/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

```
deb s3://s3.amazonaws.com/aptbucketname/repo/ trusty main contrib non-free
deb s3://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/aptbucketname/repo/ trusty main contrib non-free
deb s3://s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/aptbucketname/repo/ trusty main contrib non-free
```
